Before installing **Q-Consultation**, the following requirements must be installed on your computer:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org): Only Maintenance and LTS versions are supported (`v16`, `v18` and `v20`).

- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com): The preferred way to manage Yarn is by-project and through
[Corepack](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest/docs/api/corepack.html), a tool shipped by default with Node.js. 
Modern releases of Yarn aren't meant to be installed globally, or from npm. 

  Enable Corepack, if it isn't already: 
  ```bash
  corepack enable
  ```
